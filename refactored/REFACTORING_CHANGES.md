# Refactoring Changes Summary

This document summarizes the changes made during the refactoring of the Page Inference extension.

## Architectural Changes

1. **Modular Code Structure**
   - Separated scraper functionality into dedicated modules
   - Created a clear separation between generic and specialized scrapers
   - Implemented proper ES module imports/exports for better dependency management

2. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Added a comprehensive testing framework
   - Created standalone test scripts for each scraper
   - Implemented JSDOM for testing DOM interactions in Node.js
   - Added detailed logging for debugging

3. **Extension Integration**
   - Created a module loader to handle ES modules in Chrome Extensions
   - Updated content script to dynamically load scrapers
   - Maintained 100% compatibility with the original extension

- **`test-environment.js`**: JSDOM setup for tests
- **`run-tests.js`**: Test runner script
- **`test-generic-scraper.js`**: Standalone test for generic scraper
- **`test-linkedin-scraper.js`**: Standalone test for LinkedIn scraper
- **`refactored-content.js`**: Refactored content script entry point
