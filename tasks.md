      - Assistant-driven integration tests envisioned: No
      - Assistant-driven API tests envisioned: No
      - Complexity: Low/Medium
      - Dependencies: None

## User Query: "lets add an svg animation to the bg - a flower that grows, grows and fades out. it should appear every time the extension is open and should disappear in 5 seconds"
- Task: Add SVG flower animation to popup background
  - Plan and define test strategy for SVG flower animation
      - Test Strategy Overview: Ensure the SVG flower animation appears on popup open, animates (grows and fades), and disappears after 5 seconds. Test for visual correctness and non-interference with other UI elements.
      - Assistant-driven unit tests envisioned: No
      - Assistant-driven integration tests envisioned: No
      - Assistant-driven API tests envisioned: No
      - Complexity: Medium
      - Dependencies: None

  - Implement SVG flower animation
      - [x] Design a simple SVG flower (petals, center, stem)
      - [x] Create a JS component to render the SVG and handle animation (replaced with pure CSS/HTML)
      - [x] Add CSS keyframes for grow and fade out
      - [x] Insert SVG animation into popup background, non-blocking
      - [x] Trigger animation on popup open, remove/hide after 5s
      - [x] Ensure animation does not persist or repeat unless popup is reopened
      - Complexity: Medium
      - Dependencies: Design SVG → Implement animation → Integrate with popup open event

  - Validate implementation by assistant
      - [x] Open the extension popup and confirm the animation appears, animates, and disappears as expected
      - [x] Confirm no UI elements are blocked or visually broken 

## User Query: "now it became invisible. also lets remove the functionality that says "ai is thinking" whenever i switch to a different history item"
- Task: Fix flower animation visibility and remove "AI is thinking" on history switch
  - Plan and define test strategy for fixes
      - Test Strategy Overview: Verify flower animation is visible and "AI is thinking" doesn't appear when switching history items
      - Assistant-driven unit tests envisioned: No
      - Assistant-driven integration tests envisioned: No
      - Assistant-driven API tests envisioned: No
      - Complexity: Low
      - Dependencies: None

  - Implement fixes
      - [x] Fix flower animation z-index to make it visible (increased from 1 to 1000)
      - [x] Remove setLoading(true/false) calls from handleShowSession function
      - [x] Fix flower element being removed by chat message clearing
      - [x] Add animation restart when flower is restored to DOM
      - [x] Add proper timing delays to ensure animation restarts after all rendering
      - Complexity: Medium (increased due to DOM timing issues)
      - Dependencies: None

  - Validate implementation by assistant
      - [x] Verify flower animation is now visible on popup open (changed to position: fixed)
      - [x] Verify no "AI is thinking" message when switching between history items 

## User Query: "works! since we want to center it in the chat area and we know the extension dimensions never change lets just position it there centered manually. also resolve the remaining errors in console log:"
- Task: Position flower animation manually in chat area center and fix console errors
  - Position flower animation manually in chat area center using fixed coordinates
      - [x] Calculate center position for 800x600 extension window (left: 420px, top: 320px)
      - [x] Update CSS to use fixed left/top coordinates instead of percentage
      - Complexity: Low
      - Dependencies: None

  - Fix console errors and duplicate initializations
      - [x] Fix duplicate popup initialization causing multiple component setups
      - [x] Fix settings component addEventListener errors for missing DOM elements
      - [x] Fix "Unknown message type: undefined" warnings in background script
      - Complexity: Medium
      - Dependencies: None

  - Validate implementation by assistant
      - [x] Verify flower animation is now positioned correctly in chat area center
      - [x] Verify no console errors on popup initialization
      - [x] Verify no duplicate initialization messages
