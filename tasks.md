## Summary of Changes Made:

### 1. **Enhanced Settings UI**
- Added complete settings panel with missing elements:
  - Behavior section with repeat message trigger dropdown
  - Chat Settings section (model selector, temperature slider, feature toggles)
  - Appearance section (theme selection)
- Added CSS styling for all new elements

### 2. **New Setting Implementation**
- Added `repeatMessageTrigger` setting with three modes:
  - `auto`: Normal click → Auto-execute, Ctrl+click → Just open (default)
  - `manual`: Normal click → Just open, Ctrl+click → Auto-execute  
  - `disabled`: Never auto-execute
- Updated all default settings objects across the codebase

### 3. **Auto-Execution Logic Updates**
- Modified `autoExecuteIfNeeded()` in popup.js to check the setting
- Updated `checkForCommandToExecute()` in chat.js to respect the setting
- Modified `executeCommand()` to honor the user's preference
- Added comprehensive switch statements to handle all trigger modes
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing behavior

### 4. **Code Quality**
- Fixed variable redeclaration linter errors
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging trigger decisions
- Ensured consistent behavior across all auto-execution entry points

The feature is now fully implemented and allows users to customize how the extension behaves when they click the icon, giving them full control over when auto-execution occurs versus when the popup just opens normally.
