## Web Search Enhancement (Advanced)

The extension's web search functionality has been significantly improved with the following enhancements:

1. **Completely Restructured API Call System**:
   - Implemented a new streamlined `callOpenAI` function that better manages API calls
   - Created a robust `processOpenAIResponse` function to handle various response formats
   - Developed a dedicated `handleSequentialApiCalls` function for two-stage API requests

2. **Improved Tool Result Handling**:
   - Added more explicit instructions in follow-up messages for the model to prioritize search results
   - Implemented query extraction from user messages to provide better context
   - Clearly separated original content from search results in follow-up prompts

3. **Enhanced Mock Search Results**:
   - Expanded search result templates with more detailed and comprehensive content
   - Implemented smarter query matching with category detection
   - Added specialized responses for different types of queries (news, weather, technology, etc.)
   - Improved formatting and presentation of search results

4. **Error Handling and Logging**:
   - Added comprehensive logging throughout the API call flow
   - Implemented graceful fallbacks at each step of the process
   - Improved error reporting to provide more useful feedback to users

5. **Follow-up Query Management**:
   - Updated the message handling system to work with the new API call architecture
   - Improved context maintenance between initial queries and follow-ups
   - Enhanced spinner states and UI feedback during processing

These changes ensure that the web search tool results are properly utilized by the model in generating comprehensive responses that incorporate both the original page content and the search results when appropriate.

## Critical Sequential API Call Fix

Fixed a critical issue with the sequential API call structure that was preventing web search functionality from working properly:

1. **Proper Message Structure Implementation**:
   - Fixed the messages array structure to comply with OpenAI API requirements
   - Ensured that tool messages are properly preceded by an assistant message with tool_calls
   - Added validation to verify that the message structure is correct before making API calls

2. **Tool Call ID Matching**:
   - Ensured that each tool response has a tool_call_id that correctly matches the id of the corresponding tool call
   - Added safeguards and fallbacks for missing IDs to prevent API errors

3. **Enhanced Error Diagnostics**:
   - Added extensive validation of tool calls structure
   - Implemented detailed error logging to pinpoint message structure issues
   - Added comprehensive debug output for OpenAI API errors

4. **Proper Conversation Flow**:
   - Restructured the conversation flow to better guide the model's responses
   - Added a final user message after tool responses to clearly prompt for a summary
   - Ensured all messages are properly formatted according to OpenAI API specifications

This fixes the error "Invalid parameter: messages with role 'tool' must be a response to a preceeding message with 'tool_calls'" that was preventing the follow-up API call from working.
