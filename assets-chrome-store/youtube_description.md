WHAT IS THIS DELIGHTFUL THING?
Browse Buddy: AI Assistant with Page Reading and Search is a Chrome extension I built for my amazing wife Iuliia, bringing AI assistance directly to her browsing experience. Think of it as her personal AI assistant that actually knows what web page she's on – because she deserves technology that just works.

KEY FEATURES:
🤖 Smart AI Models - Choose between GPT-4.1 (default - complex reasoning with web search) or GPT-4.1 nano (fast daily tasks)
📖 Automatic Page Reading - Analyzes any website content without manual copying
⌨️ Smart Click Behavior - Remember and repeat questions on similar pages (perfect for analyzing multiple profiles or products)
📚 Organized Chat History - Conversations sorted by website domain with timestamps
🛡️ Privacy First - API key and conversations stay in your browser, no data collection
✨ Beautiful Interface - Dark/light themes with magical falling stars animation that shows on first install, then you control it (it's the little things)

SMART CLICK BEHAVIOR
The extension remembers your last question and can repeat it automatically on different pages - perfect for analyzing multiple similar pages with the same prompt.

🔘 Manual Mode (recommended): 
  - Normal click on Chrome extension icon: Just opens the extension normally
  - Ctrl+click (⌘+click on Mac): Opens the extension AND automatically repeats your last question on the current page
🔘 Auto Mode: 
  - Normal click on Chrome extension icon: Opens the extension AND automatically repeats your last question on the current page
  - Ctrl+click (⌘+click on Mac): Just opens the extension normally
🔘 Disabled Mode: Always just opens the extension (no automatic question repeating)

EXAMPLE: Ask "What are this person's key skills?" on one LinkedIn profile, then Ctrl+click (⌘+click on Mac) the extension icon on other profiles for instant analysis.

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Install extension and add your OpenAI API key
2. Navigate to any website
3. Click the extension icon and ask questions
4. Get intelligent responses with full page context
5. Enjoy the delightful falling stars animation on first install, then control it in settings

No more explaining what page you're on or copying content manually. Just click and chat with an AI that actually knows what you're reading.

⚠️ INSTALLATION TROUBLESHOOTING:
If the extension doesn't work after installation:
1. Check if "Developer mode" is enabled in chrome://extensions/
2. Verify your OpenAI API key is valid and has credits
3. Try refreshing the page and re-adding the API key
4. Check browser console for error messages
5. Ensure JavaScript is enabled on the website

For detailed troubleshooting, see the README on GitHub.

PRIVACY & SECURITY:
🔐 Local storage only - your data stays in your browser
📡 Direct OpenAI API communication only
🚫 No data collection or external servers
📂 Open source and fully auditable
🔒 Privacy-first page reading - content only read when you send messages, not when opening extension

Built for users who deserve technology that just works, without the usual browser extension frustrations.
