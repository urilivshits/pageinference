- **[Progressive Enhancement]** Applied layered approach to markdown rendering with multiple fallback mechanisms, ensuring content is always properly formatted regardless of library availability.
- **[Content Security Policy Compliance]** Implemented local hosting of external libraries (markdown-it and highlight.js) to comply with Chrome extension Manifest V3 CSP requirements, preventing external script loading issues.
- **[Defensive Programming]** Applied comprehensive null and undefined value checks throughout the codebase, especially in network and tab communication functions, to prevent "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors and improve extension stability.
- **[Sequential API Call Pattern]** Implemented two-stage API request system for web search functionality, with dedicated handlers for tool calls, search execution, and follow-up responses.
- **[Tool Result Processing]** Developed a robust approach for handling web search tool results, including clear separation of original content from search results and improved context maintenance.
- **[Prompt Configuration]** Custom system prompts based on website type detection to provide more relevant answers.
- **[Permissive Response System]** Enhanced system prompts to allow reasonable assumptions when page content lacks information, while clearly distinguishing between content-derived information and assumptions.
- **[Query-Content Ordering]** Optimized user query and scraped content ordering to present the user query first, improving context understanding and response relevance.
- **[Web Search Model Restriction]** Implemented a strict model enforcement policy that only allows GPT-4o mini to perform web searches, forcing all search requests to use this specific model regardless of user selection to ensure consistent search behavior and prevent automatic model selection by OpenAI.
- **[Search Model Code Simplification]** Refactored search model handling to use a dedicated SEARCH_MODEL constant, improving code clarity and making it easier to maintain by eliminating duplicate hardcoded values and using consistent variable references throughout the codebase.
- **[Query Rendering Architecture]** Investigating the UI rendering approach for user queries to ensure each submission is displayed only once in the chat interface, preventing visual duplication that affects user experience.
- **[Duplicate Detection System]** Implemented a multi-layered approach to prevent duplicate user queries from being displayed in the chat interface. Added checks in both the addMessageToChat function and the submit handler to detect and prevent duplicates at both the visual rendering and submission levels.
- **[Message Flow Optimization]** Restructured the message submission flow to eliminate the root cause of message duplication. Fixed the issue by reordering the submission process to update tab information first, then add the user message to chat after the correct context is established, preventing the double-rendering caused by history reloading.
- **[Duplicate Message Handling Refinement]** Improved the duplicate message detection approach to focus exclusively on preventing unintentional duplication during submission, while allowing users to deliberately send identical messages when needed. Removed overly aggressive content filtering that was preventing legitimate duplicate messages, improving the natural flow of conversation.
- **[Time-Based Duplicate Prevention]** Implemented a sophisticated time-based approach to duplicate message detection, replacing simplistic content matching. Now only prevents rapid duplicate submissions within a 1-second window, while allowing intentional resubmission of the same message after a brief delay. Uses local storage to track submission timestamps independently for each conversation.
- **[Focus-Based Duplication Fix]** Resolved an issue where window focus events were triggering duplicate message displays and API calls. Replaced the generic tab info update handler with a targeted version that refreshes necessary tab data without reloading the chat history, preventing message duplication when the popup window regains focus.
- **[Script Duplication Detection]** Implemented robust script initialization tracking to prevent potential duplicate loading of popup.js. Added global initialization flag, script execution tracking, and DOM mutation observation to identify and prevent multiple instances of the same script from executing simultaneously, addressing a deep-rooted cause of duplicate API calls and message submissions.
- **[Advanced Submission Protection]** Added comprehensive safeguards against duplicate form submissions with an isSubmitInProgress flag, automatic timeouts for safety resets, and proper error handling to ensure the system recovers gracefully from any state. Implemented both preventative checks at submission time and cleanup mechanisms to prevent the UI from getting stuck.
- **[Enhanced Web Search Workflow]** Implemented a robust sequential API call system that reliably executes follow-up API calls after web search requests. Added precise message structure validation, automatic correction of incorrectly formatted messages, and consistent correlation between tool calls and tool results using unique IDs to ensure the API properly processes search results.
- **[Button Placement Optimization]** Repositioned the "New Chat" button from the header to the user input area for better UX flow, following modern chat application design principles. Updated the button's visual design with clean, intuitive iconography (changing from sparkle ✨ to plus sign +), larger font size, and improved touch targets. Enhanced with consistent height alignment between all input area elements for visual harmony. Refined through iterative size increases (38px → 46px → 50px) to provide optimal proportions and maximum usability across all input elements. Animation effects were also adjusted to be less intrusive while maintaining proper visual feedback.
- **[Button Interaction Enhancement]** Improved button interaction patterns with specialized hover effects for both the "Ask" and "New Chat" buttons. Added subtle glow effect to the "Ask" button for enhanced visibility, removed zoom effect from the new chat button's unfocused state to create a cleaner visual experience, and implemented hover text functionality showing "Ask" and "New" labels on hover for clearer button purpose indication.
- **[Button Styling Refinement]** Enhanced button styling for improved consistency and usability. Fixed position jumping on hover transitions by replacing absolute positioning with flex layouts, standardized font sizes across all action buttons, and replaced text-based "+" character with an SVG icon for the New Chat button to improve visual clarity and scaling. These changes create a more polished and professional user interface with smoother interactions.
- **[UI Size Consistency]** Improved the visual consistency of UI elements by ensuring all buttons and input fields in the question container have exactly the same dimensions. Fixed an issue where the new chat button appeared larger than adjacent elements by applying explicit width constraints, adding overflow control, precisely sizing the SVG icon, and ensuring all elements have the same box model calculation with box-sizing: border-box. This creates a more cohesive and visually balanced interface with professional alignment.
- **[UI View Management]** Enhanced UI state handling for view transitions with direct approach for more reliable button focus states, preventing unintended navigation indicators.
