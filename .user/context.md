FORMAT GUIDE - DO NOT DELETE

- **[Architecture Pattern]** Implemented [pattern name] for [purpose] to enhance [benefit].
- **[Framework Selection]** Adopted [Framework Name] for [component] to improve [benefit].
-->

- **[API Selection]** Evaluated OpenAI Completions API versus Responses API for web search functionality, determining that Responses API offers superior built-in web search capabilities, simplified integration, and enhanced tools. Completions API requires custom function implementation for web search while Responses API provides a native `web_search_preview` tool that directly connects to OpenAI's search infrastructure without requiring custom implementation.
