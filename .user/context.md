## Resolved Bugs
<!-- Document fixed issues (no timestamps) -->

<!--
DO NOT DELETE THESE EXAMPLES - They serve as a format guide

- **[Bug ID/Description]** Fixed [issue description] in [file-name.js]
- **[Bug ID/Description]** Resolved [issue description] affecting [component/feature]
-->

- **[Reference Error]** Fixed "themeOptions is not defined" error in popup.js by removing a theme handler in global scope and consolidating theme-related code inside the DOMContentLoaded event handler, ensuring proper variable scoping.
- **[UI Animation]** Fixed loading spinner not displaying as a proper circle by adding box-sizing, transform-origin properties, and proper container structure. Enhanced spinner styles to prevent clipping and ensure consistent circular animation. Added flexbox display properties to perfectly center the spinner in its container.
- **[Spinner Positioning]** Resolved issue with spinner appearing in bottom right of button by replacing transform-based positioning with dedicated flex container, ensuring perfect centering regardless of button dimensions.
- **[Markdown Rendering Error]** Fixed "window.markdownit is not a function" error by correcting the library access method to use the global `markdownit` function instead of `window.markdownit`. Added robust error handling with fallback to plain text rendering if the library is unavailable.
- **[Markdown Parsing Issue]** Resolved issue where markdown was being loaded but not properly rendered in LLM responses. Implemented multi-layered approach for accessing the markdown-it library and added a custom fallback parser to ensure markdown formatting is always applied correctly.
- **[Content Security Policy Error]** Fixed Content Security Policy (CSP) errors that prevented loading external libraries from CDNs by including local copies of markdown-it and highlight.js, and updating the manifest.json with appropriate CSP settings and web_accessible_resources configurations.
- **[Undefined Property Error]** Resolved "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'startsWith')" error in background.js by implementing comprehensive null and undefined checks in tab communications, the detectWebsiteType function, and the getBaseDomain function, ensuring the extension handles missing URL data gracefully.
- **[OpenAI API Error]** Fixed "Missing required parameter: 'tools[0].function'" error in the getOpenAiInference function by correctly configuring the tools parameter for browsing-capable models, adding the required function property with proper name, description and parameters fields as per OpenAI's API requirements.
- **[UI Error Message Display]** Improved error message visibility by repositioning the error message container above the question input, adding z-index and overflow properties, implementing automatic scrolling to ensure errors are always visible, and adding an auto-hide timeout for better user experience.
- **[Persistent OpenAI API Error]** Resolved persistent "Missing required parameter: 'tools[0].function'" error by completely restructuring the tools configuration to follow the latest OpenAI API requirements. Changed the tool type from 'web_search' to 'function' and properly formatted all nested properties to ensure API compatibility.
- **[API Response Null Content Error]** Fixed "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'trim')" error by implementing robust response handling for different OpenAI API response structures. Added explicit handling for cases where the model uses tool_calls (resulting in null content), extracting meaningful information from tool_calls, and providing user-friendly messages about web search operations.
- **[Enhanced API Response Handling]** Implemented comprehensive defensive programming for API response processing with extensive null checks at every level of the response object hierarchy. Added detailed logging for debugging, explicit type checking before operations, and multiple fallback messages for different error conditions. This ensures the extension remains stable regardless of unexpected API response structures or content values.
- **[API Response Format Fix]** Resolved persistent "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'trim')" error by completely rewriting the API response handling to specifically target the exact format received from the OpenAI API for gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18. Simplified the code structure with targeted handling for each response case, improved error handling, and added more detailed logging to facilitate debugging of response formats.
- **[Web Search Implementation]** Implemented robust web search capabilities for supported models through a sequential API call pattern that handles tool calls with null content, executes the search, and returns comprehensive answers in a follow-up API call. Added detailed documentation in README.md about the technical implementation and user-facing experience.
- **[Null Content Trim Fix]** Comprehensively resolved all instances of the "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'trim')" error by reorganizing content handling logic to explicitly check for null values before any string operations. Improved the structure of response processing to handle various edge cases in both main inference and sequential API calls.
- **[Enhanced Error Handling Architecture]** Implemented a defense-in-depth approach to handling API responses by restructuring the entire response processing flow to prioritize null content checks above all other operations. Added comprehensive error handling with detailed logs and user-friendly messages for every potential edge case, ensuring the extension remains stable even with unexpected API responses.
- **[Error Text Validation Fix]** Fixed "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'trim')" error by adding proper null and type checks before calling trim() on errorText in the error handling section of the getOpenAiInference function, ensuring robust handling of API error responses.
- **[Advanced Debugging Implementation]** Enhanced error handling with comprehensive debugging logs throughout the API response processing flow. Added detailed structure validation, explicit null/undefined checks, and step-by-step tracing of content handling to identify and prevent "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'trim')" errors.
- **[Tool Calls Processing Fix]** Resolved "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'trim')" error by implementing proper handling of OpenAI API responses where content is null but tool_calls are present. Added specialized processing for web_search function calls that extracts the search query and provides a user-friendly message about the search operation being performed.
- **[Tab Communication Resilience]** Fixed "Receiving end does not exist" error by implementing a robust retry mechanism for tab communication. Added better error handling for content script injection, longer initialization delays, and progressive timeouts between retries to ensure successful communication with the active tab even under slow loading conditions.
- **[Critical Sequential API Call Fix]** Fixed an issue with the sequential API call structure by ensuring proper message structure implementation complying with OpenAI API requirements, implementing tool call ID matching, enhancing error diagnostics, and ensuring proper conversation flow.
- **[Search Query Matching Fix]** Resolved a critical issue where web search queries were mismatched with actual user questions by improving topic extraction logic, implementing search topic prioritization, adding specialized content handlers, and enhancing context clarification in follow-up messages.
- **[Slider Thumb Visibility Enhancement]** Fixed invisible temperature slider thumb by adding missing `--accent-color` CSS variable and enhancing slider styling with improved visibility properties. Implemented a dynamic gradient track that visually represents the current value, improved cross-browser compatibility with Firefox-specific styles, and added visual enhancements including borders and shadows for better contrast in both light and dark themes. Corrected vertical alignment issues with precise margin adjustments and added hover effects for improved user interaction.
