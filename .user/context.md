<!--
DO NOT DELETE THESE EXAMPLES - They serve as a format guide

- **[Framework Selection]** Adopted [Framework Name] for [component] to improve [benefit].
- **[Architecture Pattern]** Implemented [pattern name] for [purpose] to enhance [benefit].
-->

- **[Browser Extension Architecture]** Chrome extension using Manifest V3 for improved security and performance.
- **[Communication Pattern]** Background service worker for API communication with content scripts for page interaction.
- **[UI Framework]** Vanilla JavaScript with custom CSS for a lightweight and responsive UI.
- **[Data Storage]** Chrome's Storage API for secure storage of API keys and configuration.
- **[API Integration]** OpenAI API for content processing and question answering capabilities.
- **[Model Selection]** Default model set to gpt-4o-mini with options for gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4, and gpt-4o.
- **[Theme Management]** Support for system, light, and dark themes with automatic detection of system preferences.
- **[Event Handling]** DOM-scoped event handlers to maintain proper variable access and prevent reference errors.
- **[CSS Box Model]** Explicit box-sizing and proper transform handling for UI animations and styled components.
- **[Flexbox Layout]** Applied flexbox display properties to buttons and containers for proper element centering and alignment.
- **[Container-Based Positioning]** Implemented dedicated flex containers for UI elements requiring precise positioning, improving layout reliability across different screen sizes.
- **[Markdown Rendering]** Implemented markdown-it for rendering LLM responses with proper formatting, supporting code blocks with syntax highlighting through highlight.js.
- **[Error Handling]** Added robust error handling for external libraries with graceful fallbacks to maintain functionality even when dependencies fail.
- **[Progressive Enhancement]** Applied layered approach to markdown rendering with multiple fallback mechanisms, ensuring content is always properly formatted regardless of library availability.
- **[Content Security Policy Compliance]** Implemented local hosting of external libraries (markdown-it and highlight.js) to comply with Chrome extension Manifest V3 CSP requirements, preventing external script loading issues.

- **[Feature Name]** Implemented [feature description] ([relevant-file.js], [another-file.js])
- **[Feature Name]** Added [feature description] with support for [capability] ([relevant-files])
-->

- **[Content Extraction]** Implemented page content extraction in content.js.
- **[Question Answering]** Added capability to answer questions about web pages using OpenAI's GPT models (popup.js, background.js).
- **[Settings Management]** Implemented secure API key storage and model selection (popup.js, background.js).
- **[UI Components]** Created modern user interface with conversation history and settings panel (popup.html, styles.css).
- **[History Management]** Added conversation history management for previous sessions (popup.js).
- **[Website Type Detection]** Implemented automatic detection of website types for specialized system prompts (background.js).
- **[Theme Customization]** Added theme selection with system, light, and dark modes (popup.js, styles.css).
- **[Advanced Model Support]** Added support for web browsing capabilities in certain models like gpt-4o and gpt-4-turbo (background.js).
- **[Loading Indicators]** Enhanced loading indicators with proper animation, responsive behavior, and perfect centering (styles.css, popup.js, popup.html).
- **[Markdown Formatting]** Added support for rich formatting of LLM responses using markdown-it, including headings, lists, code blocks with syntax highlighting, blockquotes, and more (popup.js, styles.css).
- **[Fallback Markdown Parser]** Implemented custom lightweight markdown parser as a fallback when external libraries are unavailable, ensuring core formatting capabilities are always available (popup.js).
- **[Local Library Management]** Added local copies of markdown-it and highlight.js libraries rather than loading from CDNs, ensuring extension functionality despite Content Security Policy restrictions (lib/).

## Resolved Bugs
<!-- Document fixed issues (no timestamps) -->

<!--
DO NOT DELETE THESE EXAMPLES - They serve as a format guide

- **[Bug ID/Description]** Fixed [issue description] in [file-name.js]
- **[Bug ID/Description]** Resolved [issue description] affecting [component/feature]
-->

- **[Reference Error]** Fixed "themeOptions is not defined" error in popup.js by removing a theme handler in global scope and consolidating theme-related code inside the DOMContentLoaded event handler, ensuring proper variable scoping.
- **[UI Animation]** Fixed loading spinner not displaying as a proper circle by adding box-sizing, transform-origin properties, and proper container structure. Enhanced spinner styles to prevent clipping and ensure consistent circular animation. Added flexbox display properties to perfectly center the spinner in its container.
- **[Spinner Positioning]** Resolved issue with spinner appearing in bottom right of button by replacing transform-based positioning with dedicated flex container, ensuring perfect centering regardless of button dimensions.
- **[Markdown Rendering Error]** Fixed "window.markdownit is not a function" error by correcting the library access method to use the global `markdownit` function instead of `window.markdownit`. Added robust error handling with fallback to plain text rendering if the library is unavailable.
- **[Markdown Parsing Issue]** Resolved issue where markdown was being loaded but not properly rendered in LLM responses. Implemented multi-layered approach for accessing the markdown-it library and added a custom fallback parser to ensure markdown formatting is always applied correctly.
- **[Content Security Policy Error]** Fixed Content Security Policy (CSP) errors that prevented loading external libraries from CDNs by including local copies of markdown-it and highlight.js, and updating the manifest.json with appropriate CSP settings and web_accessible_resources configurations.

## Documentation Status
- **[README Review]** README.md accurately describes the extension functionality, installation process, and troubleshooting steps. The model options listed in the README (GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4) are available in the actual implementation, which also includes the newer gpt-4o-mini (default) and gpt-4o models.
- **[README Update]** Enhanced README.md with complete information about all available models, theme customization options, website type detection capabilities, and advanced browsing features. Documentation now fully reflects the current state of the project.
