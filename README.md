# üå∏ Iuliia's Lil Helper

*Made with love for my brilliant wife, who deserves all the help browsers can give.*

## What is this delightful thing?

Iuliia's Lil Helper is a Chrome extension I built for my amazing wife Iuliia, bringing AI assistance directly to her browsing experience. Think of it as her personal AI assistant that actually knows what web page she's on ‚Äì because she deserves technology that just works.

## ‚ú® Features That Actually Work

### ü§ñ AI Models & Intelligence
Choose between two powerful AI models, each with automatic page content analysis:
- **GPT-4.1 nano** (Default): The newest, fastest, and most cost-effective model - perfect for daily browsing tasks
- **GPT-4.1**: The powerhouse reasoning model with **real-time web search** for complex research and current information

#### Model Specifications
| Model | Context Window | Cost (Input/Output) | Page Content Scraping | Web Search | Best For | Key Benchmarks |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------|----------|----------------|
| **GPT-4.1 nano** | 1M tokens | $0.10/$0.40 per million | ‚úÖ Always enabled | ‚ùå Disabled for speed | Daily tasks, quick questions | 80.1% MMLU, 50.3% GPQA, 74.5% IFEval |
| **GPT-4.1** | 1M tokens | $2.00/$8.00 per million | ‚úÖ Always enabled | ‚úÖ Real-time information | Complex reasoning, research | 90.2% MMLU, 66.3% GPQA, 87.4% IFEval, 54.6% SWE-Bench |

### ‚å®Ô∏è Smart Click Behavior
The extension remembers your last question and can repeat it automatically on different pages - perfect for analyzing multiple similar pages with the same prompt.

- **Manual Mode** (recommended): 
  - Normal click on Chrome extension icon: Just opens the extension normally
  - Ctrl+click on Chrome extension icon: Opens the extension AND automatically repeats your last question on the current page
- **Auto Mode**: 
  - Normal click on Chrome extension icon: Opens the extension AND automatically repeats your last question on the current page
  - Ctrl+click on Chrome extension icon: Just opens the extension normally
- **Disabled Mode**: Always just opens the extension (no automatic question repeating)

**Example**: Ask "What are this person's key skills?" on one LinkedIn profile, then Ctrl+click the extension icon on other profiles for instant analysis.

### üì± Interface & Experience
- **Chat History**: Organized by website domain with search and filtering because we're not animals
- **Dark/Light Themes**: Because your retinas matter
- **Flower Animation**: A delightful SVG flower blooms every time you open the extension (it's the little things)
- **Message Timestamps**: See exactly when you asked that embarrassing question
- **Copy Messages**: Share the AI's wisdom with the world
- **Temperature Control**: Adjust response creativity (0.0 = robotic, 1.0 = artistic)
- **Multiple Sessions**: Context switching without losing your conversation threads

## üöÄ Getting Started

- Ctrl+click behavior requires JavaScript to be enabled (shocking, we know)
- The extension popup has a fixed size because responsive design is for websites
