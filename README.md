2. Ensure all files are in place:
   - manifest.json
   - background.js
   - content.js
   - popup.html
   - popup.js
   - styles.css

2. Click the extension icon in Chrome's toolbar

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Icon Not Showing
- Make sure you've created the icon files in the `icons` directory as specified in the README there
- Reload the extension in `chrome://extensions/` if you've added the icons after installation

### "Error communicating with page"
- Make sure you're on an active tab with a loaded webpage
- Some websites with strict security policies may block content scripts
- Try refreshing the page and trying again

### API Key Issues
- Double-check that you've entered a valid OpenAI API key
- Make sure your OpenAI account has access to the selected model
- Verify that your API key has sufficient credits/quota

### OpenAI API Errors
- "Rate limit exceeded": Wait and try again later as you've exceeded your API usage limits
- "Invalid model": The selected model may not be available for your API key
- "Token limit exceeded": The page content plus your question may be too long; try a shorter question or use on a page with less content

## Development

The extension is built using vanilla JavaScript and follows Chrome's extension best practices. Here's the project structure:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json        # Extension configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ popup.html          # Extension popup interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ popup.js           # Popup interaction logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css         # UI styling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content.js         # Page content extraction
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ background.js      # Background script for API communication
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ icons/             # Extension icons
```

## Testing Guide

To test if the extension is working properly:

1. **Basic Installation Test**

2. **Content Script Test**
   - Navigate to a simple webpage like Wikipedia
   - Click the extension icon and ask a simple question about the page
   - Verify that the content is being extracted correctly

3. **API Integration Test**
   - Enter your OpenAI API key in the settings
   - Ask a specific question about the page content
   - Verify that you receive a relevant answer

4. **Edge Cases**
   - Test on complex pages with lots of dynamic content
   - Test on pages with minimal content
   - Test with very specific questions
   - Test with very broad questions
