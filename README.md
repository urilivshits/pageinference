# üå∏ Iuliia's Lil Helper

*Made with love for my brilliant wife, who deserves all the help browsers can give.*

## What is this delightful thing?

Iuliia's Lil Helper is a Chrome extension I built for my amazing wife Iuliia, bringing AI assistance directly to her browsing experience. Think of it as her personal AI assistant that actually knows what web page she's on ‚Äì because she deserves technology that just works.

## ‚ú® Features That Actually Work

### üß† AI-Powered Chat
- **Smart Context Awareness**: The AI always reads the page content automatically ‚Äì no fiddling with settings required
- **Multiple AI Models**: Choose from GPT-4o mini, GPT-4.1 nano, or o4-mini Deep Research
- **Temperature Control**: Dial up the creativity or keep it professional
- **Page-Focused Intelligence**: Designed to understand and work with the content you're actually looking at

### ü§ñ AI Model Selection
Choose the right AI model for your needs:
- **GPT-4.1 nano** (Default): The newest, fastest, and most cost-effective model - perfect for most daily browsing tasks
- **o4-mini Deep Research**: The powerhouse reasoning model for complex analysis, detailed research, and when you need the AI to really think deeply about content

#### Model Specifications
| Model | Context Window | Cost (Input/Output) | Best For | Key Benchmarks |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|----------|----------------|
| **GPT-4.1 nano** | 1M tokens | $0.10/$0.40 per million | Daily tasks, quick questions | 80.1% MMLU |

### ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Wizardry & Smart Shortcuts
- **Ctrl+Shift+Y**: The magic shortcut! Instantly re-runs your last question on whatever page you're currently viewing
- **Smart Click Behavior**: The extension remembers your last question and can repeat it automatically
  - *Manual Mode* (recommended): Normal click just opens the extension, Ctrl+click repeats your last question
  - *Auto Mode*: Normal click repeats your last question, Ctrl+click just opens normally  
  - *Disabled Mode*: Always just opens the extension (no automatic question repeating)
- **How it works**: Ask a question on any page, then later use Ctrl+Shift+Y or your configured click method to ask the same question on a different page

### üì± Interface Niceties
- **Chat History**: Organized by website domain because we're not animals
- **Search Your Chats**: Find that one conversation from three weeks ago

- **Copy Messages**: Share the AI's wisdom with the world

### üîß Power User Features

   - Paste your OpenAI API key and hit Save
   - Your key is stored locally and never sent to our servers (because we're not that kind of extension)

3. **Start Chatting**:
   - Navigate to any website
   - Click the extension icon
   - Ask the AI about the page, or anything really
   - Watch the magic happen ‚ú®

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings & Configuration
