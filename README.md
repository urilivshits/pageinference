# ü§ñ Browse Buddy: AI Assistant with Page Reading and Search

*Made with love for my brilliant wife, who deserves all the help browsers can give.*

## What is this delightful thing?

Browse Buddy: AI Assistant with Page Reading and Search is a Chrome extension I built for my amazing wife Iuliia, bringing AI assistance directly to her browsing experience. Think of it as her personal AI assistant that actually knows what web page she's on ‚Äì because she deserves technology that just works.

## ‚ú® Features That Actually Work

### ü§ñ AI Models & Intelligence
Choose between two powerful AI models, each with automatic page content analysis:
- **GPT-4.1 nano**: The newest, fastest, and most cost-effective model - perfect for daily browsing tasks
- **GPT-4.1** (Default): The powerhouse reasoning model with **real-time web search** for complex research and current information

#### Model Specifications
| Model | Context Window | Cost (Input/Output) | Page Content Scraping | Web Search | Best For | Key Benchmarks |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------|----------|----------------|
| **GPT-4.1 nano** | 1M tokens | $0.10/$0.40 per million | ‚úÖ Always enabled | ‚ùå Disabled for speed | Daily tasks, quick questions | 80.1% MMLU, 50.3% GPQA, 74.5% IFEval |
| **GPT-4.1** | 1M tokens | $2.00/$8.00 per million | ‚úÖ Always enabled | ‚úÖ Real-time information | Complex reasoning, research | 90.2% MMLU, 66.3% GPQA, 87.4% IFEval, 54.6% SWE-Bench |

### ‚å®Ô∏è Smart Click Behavior
The extension remembers your last question and can repeat it automatically on different pages - perfect for analyzing multiple similar pages with the same prompt.

- **Manual Mode** (recommended): 
  - Normal click on Chrome extension icon: Just opens the extension normally
  - Ctrl+click (‚åò+click on Mac): Opens the extension AND automatically repeats your last question on the current page
- **Auto Mode**: 
  - Normal click on Chrome extension icon: Opens the extension AND automatically repeats your last question on the current page
  - Ctrl+click (‚åò+click on Mac): Just opens the extension normally
- **Disabled Mode**: Always just opens the extension (no automatic question repeating)

**Example**: Ask "What are this person's key skills?" on one LinkedIn profile, then Ctrl+click (‚åò+click on Mac) the extension icon on other profiles for instant analysis.

### üì± Interface & Experience
- **Chat History**: Organized by website domain with search and filtering because we're not animals
- **Dark/Light Themes**: Because your retinas matter
- **Stars Animation**: Magical falling stars cascade from top-right to bottom-left when you open the extension. Shows automatically on first install, then you can control it in settings (it's the little things)
- **Message Timestamps**: See exactly when you asked that embarrassing question
- **Copy Messages**: Share the AI's wisdom with the world
- **Temperature Control**: Adjust response creativity (0.0 = robotic, 1.0 = artistic)
- **Multiple Sessions**: Context switching without losing your conversation threads

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A Chrome browser (or Chromium-based browser with extension support)
- An OpenAI API key ([get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
- A sense of humor about delightful stars animations

### Installation
1. **Load the Extension**: 
   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension folder
   
2. **Add Your API Key**:

   - Click on Iuliia's profile icon in the top right
   - Paste your OpenAI API key and hit Save
   - Your key is stored locally and only used for OpenAI API calls (no other servers involved)

3. **Start Chatting**:
   - Navigate to any website
   - Click the extension icon
   - Ask the AI about the page, or anything really
   - Watch the magic happen ‚ú®

## üéÆ How to Use

### Basic Usage
1. Click the extension icon
2. Type your question
3. Hit Enter and enjoy intelligent responses with page context

### Power Moves
- **Model Switching**: Change between nano/full GPT-4.1 via the profile icon
- **Repeat Questions**: Use Ctrl+click (‚åò+click on Mac) behavior (configurable in settings)

- **Open Source**: All code is visible and auditable
- **Privacy-First Page Reading**: Page content is only read when you click the send button (not when opening the extension), and only once per conversation for maximum privacy

## üêõ Known Quirks

- The falling stars animation is non-negotiable (feature, not bug); it brings cosmic joy
- Sometimes the AI gets a little too excited about page content
- Ctrl+click behavior requires JavaScript to be enabled (shocking, we know)
- The extension popup has a fixed size because responsive design is for websites
